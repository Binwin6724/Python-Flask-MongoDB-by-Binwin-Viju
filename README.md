## To Download
* install python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Python download link").
* install MongoDB Community server from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community "MongoDB download link").
* install visual studio code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download "VS code download link").
* install postman from [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/ "postman download link").
## Setup machine
* Need to create flask and mongo folder in **C:\flask\mongo** 
* Open VS Code in mongo folder
## Setup Code
* Go to terminal and 
   * type **python -m venv .** for windows users. 
   * type **virtualenv -p python .** for mac users.
* Go to terminal and
   * run **Scripts/activate** for windows users.
   * type **source bin/activate** for mac users.

   * pip install flask
   * pip install pymongo
 ## Run Code
 * **py server.py** for windows user.
 * **sudo python server.py** for mac user.
 ## How does it works!!!

So in order to work this we must run the code as mentioned above. We also need to start our MongoDB Community Server.

After running the code we can see some result like :-
  * Serving Flask app 'server' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:80 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 124-615-963

Then open post man and u can insert data to MongoDB using

when we click send it will be stored in our MongoDB.
To see our data using postman we need to use GET method
